# utils.spec.predicates

Selected, generic predicates that you might find handy when specing things.

## Installation

```clojure
[com.nedap.staffing-solutions/utils.spec.predicates "1.0.0"]
```

## Documentation

Please browse the public namespaces, which are documented, speced and tested.

## Development

The default namespace is `dev`. Under it, `(refresh)` is available, which should give you a basic "Reloaded workflow".

> It is recommended that you use `(clojure.tools.namespace.repl/refresh :after 'formatting-stack.core/format!)`.
